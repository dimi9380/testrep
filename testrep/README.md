# APPM 4600 Numerical Methods Repository

This repository contains my homework and lab files for my **APPM 4600 Numerical Methods** course for the Spring 2025 semester. It is organized to
provide easy access to all the coursework, with a clear directory structure that categorizes files based on their type and purpose. Below is
an overview of what this repository includes:

## Repository Contents
   1. **Homework**
		- A subdirectory that contains all assigned homework problems and their solutions.
		- Each homework set is stored in its own folder, named 'hw1', 'hw2', etc., and includes relevant scripts and explainations.
   2. **Labs**
		- A subdirectory containing files for in-class lab assignments.
		- Includes relevant programming scripts used for computational excersies, along with any accompanying reports.

This repository contains all the work I'll complete in APPM 4600, making it easy to track my progress and revisit key concepts as needed.
